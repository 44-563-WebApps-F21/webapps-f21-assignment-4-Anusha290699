        <h6>JACK.</h6>
        <p>I suppose so, if you want to.</p> 
        
        <h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
        <p>Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not
        serious about meals. It is so shallow of them.</p> 
        
        <p>[Enter Lane.]</p> 
        
        <h6>LANE.</h6>
        <p>Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.</p> 
        
        <p>[Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and
        Gwendolen.]</p> 
        
        <h6>LADY BRACKNELL.</h6>
        <p>Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.</p> 
        
        <h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
        <p>I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
        
        <h6>LADY BRACKNELL.</h6>
        <p>That’s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go
        together.</p>  
        <p>[Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]</p> 
        
        <h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
        <p>[To Gwendolen.]</p> 
        <p>Dear me, you are smart!</p> 
        
        <h6>GWENDOLEN.</h6>
        <p>I am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?</p> 
        
       <h6>JACK.</h6>
       <p>You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.</p>
