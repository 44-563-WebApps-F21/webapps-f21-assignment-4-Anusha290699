                JACK.
                I suppose so, if you want to.
                <br>
                ALGERNON.
                Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not
                serious about meals. It is so shallow of them.
                <br>
                [Enter Lane.]
                <br>
                LANE.
                Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.
                <br>
                [Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and
                Gwendolen.]
                <br>
                LADY BRACKNELL.
                Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.
                <br>
                ALGERNON.
                I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.
                <br>
                LADY BRACKNELL.
                That’s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go
                together. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]
                <br>
                ALGERNON.
                [To Gwendolen.] Dear me, you are smart!
                <br>
                GWENDOLEN.
                I am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?
                <br>
                JACK.
                You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.
